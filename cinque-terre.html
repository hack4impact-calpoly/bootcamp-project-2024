      <p class="blog-content">
        Up on the western coast of northern Italy, Cinque Terre is a collection
        of five small towns. On the first weekend of October, my friends and I
        trained up to La Spezia which is just south of Cinque Terre. We arrived
        around 7pm which gave us enough time to catch the last bus to our
        Airbnb.
        <br /><br />
        Opting to maximize our time in Cinque Terre, we decided for a very early
        morning. Not only would it beat the tourism traffic but it would give us
        the time to visit as many of the 5 towns as possible. Plus, there was
        only 1 bus that ran from our somewhat isolated Airbnb to the train
        station, so we either had to catch the 7am bus or hike 2.5 hours down.
        <br /><br />
        Starting at the furthestmost town, Monterosso, we picked up some
        breakfast and food for our hike. After some stunning sunrise pictures,
        we started our hike. The original plan was to hike between all 5 towns,
        which would take around 9 hours. Unfortunately, due to landslides, the
        hikes between the three towns furthest south were closed. Still, the
        leaves us with a couple hikes, so starting with Monterosso, we'd hike
        down to the next town, Vernazza, and down one more to Corniglia.
        Depending on time, we'd then take a train to Manarole and Riomaggiore.
        <br /><br />
        The hike was beautiful. Walking right along the mountain edge, there is
        a breath-taking view of the crystal-clear water, lush forests, and the
        growing appearance of the next town. The elevation was a bit tough
        because it seemed like at any given moment we were climbing several
        flights of stairs only to immediately go back down them. The zig-zagged
        trail with stairs made what seemed a short distance substantially
        further and more challenging. It was actuallly kinda funny. Whenever
        we'd pass by other hikers going the opposite direction, they always
        sounded so sad, upset, and/or discouraged. At one point, one of them
        told us, "Brace yourself!"; another hiker exclaimed "No you're not!"
        when we said we were close; many others simply wished us luck as we'd
        certainly need it. Personally, I found it more funny than discouraging
        because we were having a great time on the hike, enjoying the scenary
        and all.
        <br /><br />
        We only had time for Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, and Manarole on
        Saturday, so on Sunday, we trained over to Riomaggiore for our final
        town.
